          <h3>Vincent</h3>
          <p>
            This was a great experience. This place has a sauna! A hot tub, its
            in the middle of nature, the stars are beautiful and you are really
            in the jungle. The place itself is very pretty and I cannot express
            enough how comfortable it was and well setup/designed. We loved our
            stay. It was near everything and made us really feel like we got an
            authentic experience.
          </p>

          <span class="hide" id="hideText1">
            Bonus points bc we heard monkeys while in the hot tub right above us
            and also checked out a secret trail that led to a river! It was
            amazing! Noehmy was such a great host, and very communicative. She
            gave us great recos (which we tried!! A restaurant and a place that
            played awesome music for a night out). Thanks for everything

          <h3>Julius</h3>
          <p>
            Our stay at the Airbnb in Uvita, Costa Rica, was nothing short of
            spectacular. Nestled in the lush jungle with breathtaking views of
            the Pacific Ocean, this home provided the perfect blend of luxury,
            comfort, and tropical charm. The pool was a true highlight—perfectly
            positioned to soak in the stunning sunsets, surrounded by the sounds
            of nature.
          </p>
          <span class="hide" id="hideText2">
            Relaxing in the hot tub after a day of exploring was an absolute
            dream, and the outdoor shower added a refreshing, spa-like
            experience. The home itself was beautifully designed with an
            open-concept layout, featuring a massive chef's kitchen that made
            preparing meals a joy. Fully stocked with top-of-the-line appliances
            and plenty of space, it was ideal for cooking up fresh local
            ingredients. The spacious living areas provided a perfect space to
            unwind, while the private bedrooms offered comfort and tranquility,
            each with its own unique view. Great location close to good beaches
            and city center.

          <h3>Billy</h3>
          <p>
            Nahomy's place is wonderful! My partner and I spent five days there
            and enjoyed every minute. We felt very comfortable because of the
            beautiful kitchen, Bluetooth stereo, well stocked bathrooms, washer
            & dryer, and of course the Jacuzzi & sauna. If that wasn't enough,
            Nahomy gave us incredible recommendations that gave us plenty to do
            and was extremely responsive. A top tier host! Book asap!

          <p>
            Wow, what an incredible and standout airbnb in the Uvita area! Not
            only was the house spectacular but the hosts were incredible and
            extremely helpful with ally needs and questions about the house and
            the area. The airbnb itself was perfection and they thought of
            everything someone could possibly need. The hot tub was perfect,
            especially in those rainy moments, the kitchen was fully stocked,
            the showers were excellent,
          </p>
          <span class="hide" id="hideText"
            >the AC was a strong and the house was styled beautifully. Plenty of
            toucans and Congo monkeys graced the trees every morning and the
            waterhole on the property was super cool. Highly recommend this
            airbnb!
